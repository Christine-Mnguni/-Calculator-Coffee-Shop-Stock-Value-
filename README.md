# ☕ Coffee Shop Stock Value Calculator

# 📋 Project Overview
This Python script calculates the total stock value of a coffee shop menu by multiplying the stock quantity of each item with its price. It demonstrates basic Python data structures like lists and dictionaries, along with simple control flow using a for loop.

# 🧾 How It Works
A Menu list stores the available items:
["Latte", "Espresso", "Tea", "Iced coffee"]

Two dictionaries are used:

stock: contains the available quantity for each menu item.

price: stores the price per item.

A loop iterates through the menu:

For each item, it retrieves the stock and price.

It calculates the value by multiplying stock by price.

The total stock value should be accumulated.
